📚 DSA Practice Repository
This repository contains my structured Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation journey. 
It includes categorized problems and implementations in C++, organized topic-wise for better learning and revision.

STL Usage


⚙️ Languages Used
C++ – All implementations and problem-solving are done in C++. The use of .cpp files with corresponding .exe (executables) shows compiled code for testing.

🧪 How to Run
To compile and run any file:

g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe
./filename.exe
Or, if using VS Code with Code Runner extension, just press Ctrl+Alt+N.

📌 Purpose
This repo is part of my placement preparation strategy. It is structured for:

Consistent topic-wise learning
|
Efficient revision
|
Mastery of core DSA concepts

🔖 Notes
This repo is best browsed inside a code editor like VS Code for full navigation.
This repo is in its development phase, I will soon complete this with markdown too.

Happy Coding
